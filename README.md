Mission
Building AI companions to the next level with advanced multi-modal capabilities.
Why This GitHub Repo?
We are committed to building in public for several reasons:

It helps us collect early user feedback.
It serves as an effective channel for initial marketing and growth.
It can help us grow our team and find the right people.

Open Source vs. Closed Source
There has been much discussion around whether to take an open-source approach. Many hot GitHub projects have turned into small startups, serving as a way to test early Product-Market Fit (PMF). RealChar and GPT Girlfriend are examples of using open source effectively.
However, there is a fundamental difference between open source and closed source approaches. Open source is primarily for developers, while we're building something for users who might not have a technical background. Data security might be more important than open-source code in our case.
We've created this repo to:
Share our roadmap publicly.
Consider providing some sort of platform API in the future.

Our initial thought on opportunity
Character.ai is recently bought by Google. Players like [Crushon.ai](https://crushon.ai) and [Spicychat](https://spicychat.ai/) are getting more and more popular. However,
how to design a game like mechansim and how to deliver better multi model is question needs to be answered.

Our Roadmap
July - August: Onboard AI Art feature
September - October: Improve Chat feature
November - December: TBD

We're excited about the journey ahead and look forward to your feedback and support!
