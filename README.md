# ROLEMANTIC

## Mission
[Rolemantic.ai](https://rolemantic.ai): Building AI companions to the next level with advanced multi-modal capabilities.

## Why This GitHub Repo?
We are committed to building in public for several reasons:
- It helps us collect early user feedback.
- It serves as an effective channel for initial marketing and growth.
- It can help us grow our team and find the right people.

## Open Source vs. Closed Source
There has been much discussion around whether to take an open-source approach. Many hot GitHub projects have turned into small startups, serving as a way to test early Product-Market Fit (PMF). *RealChar* and *GPT Girlfriend* are examples of using open source effectively. 

However, there is a fundamental difference between open source and closed source approaches:
- **Open source** is primarily for developers.
- We're building something for users who might not have a technical background.
- Data security might be more important than open-source code in our case.

We've created this repo to:
- Share our roadmap publicly.
- Consider providing some sort of platform API in the future.

## Our Initial Thought on Opportunity
- *Character.ai* is recently bought by Google.
- Players like [Crushon.ai](https://crushon.ai) and [Spicychat](https://spicychat.ai) are getting more and more popular.
- However, how to design a game-like mechanism and how to deliver better multi-modal capabilities is a question that still needs to be answered.

## Our Roadmap
- **July - August**: Onboard AI Art feature
- **September - October**: Improve Chat feature
- **November - December**: TBD

We're excited about the journey ahead and look forward to your feedback and support!
